Yesterday `CERT.GOV.GE` hosted CyberCube-2020 in Georgia.

The Olympiad was hosted online for the first time,Due to COVID19.Exercises were kinda CTFish, but it was a lot of fun.
I decided to share some of them with you.



# [](#header-1)Final.txt
We are given txt file,we should investigate it and get the flag.
Running `file` against it prints that it's an ASCII text.After looking at `cat` output it looks like base64 encoded data.

So i decoded it and redirected output to final2.txt

`cat final.txt | base64 -d > final2.txt`

It looks like hex, we can reverse it to binary with `xxd`:

Running It prints a flag

# [](#header-2)м®.яøß()7

We are given a link to youtube video, that we can download as an avi file via github from description.

So i downloaded file and ran `file`, `binwalk` and `7z` against it

Output shows that there's hidden file `important.txt` that can be extracted, although it's password protected.

Going back and rewatching the video we see password `Dylan_2791`

Extract files with `7z` and we get the flag

# [](#header-2)Magic-Zip

We are given zip file that seems to be corrupted

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x70sec/0x70sec.github.io/master/assets/cybercube2020/31.png)

First of all i ran `zip -F and -FF` against it, but it didn't work

After that i opened it in `hexeditor` and saw that first 2 bytes were `00 00` after that `03 04`

After some research i found magic bytes of ZIP

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x70sec/0x70sec.github.io/master/assets/cybercube2020/33.png)

Fixed it and tried extracting the content but it was password protected

So i brute forced it with `rockyou.txt` and found the password

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x70sec/0x70sec.github.io/master/assets/cybercube2020/37.png)

And the flag
