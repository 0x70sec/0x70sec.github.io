# [](#header-1)Speeds and feeds
* `Category: Reverse Engineering`
* `Author: Ryan Ramseyer`
* `Points: 50`
* `Description: There is something on my shop network running at nc mercury.picoctf.net 16524, but I can't tell what it is. Can you?`

Connecting with netcat outputs weird encoding that looks like coordinates.

After googling G0Z0.1 I've found out that it's GCODE encoding, There's a nice website ncviewer.com,for CNC and 3D printer files.i redirected netcat output to a file and uploaded it to gcode viewer.

### [](#header-1)Caas
* `Category: Web Exploitation`
* `Author: BROWNIEINMOTION`
* `Points: 150`
* `Description: Now presenting cowsay as a service.`

We are given link to the website and source code.

Inspecting source code I see that it uses binary `/usr/games/cowsay`, which prints whatever is supplied after `/cowsay` in URL.

Input has no Filter / Inspection, which gives us opportunity for `Code Injcetion`. 

I used `;` for separating 2 commands.

`url/cowsay/whatever; ls` for listing the current directory.

`url/cowsay/whatever; cat flag.txt` for reading the flag.

`Flag :`

### [](#header-1)Dachshund Attacks
* `Category: Cryptography`
* `Author: SARA`
* `Points: 80`
* `Description: What if d is too small? Connect with nc mercury.picoctf.net 62786.`

This is a [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) Cipher Challenge.After connecting with netcat on port 62786, I get challenge clues specifially, `e (public key)`, `n (public key)`, and `c (cipher message)`.

I can decrypt RSA with prime numbers (P, Q) or it can be decrypted with private key and public key (D, N). [Wiener's attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_attack). The attack uses the continued fraction method to expose the private key d when d is small.

I used [dcode.fr](https://dcode.fr/en) for decrypting this challenge.
Used given N and E values in attack.

With `D P Q` I could decrypt the flag with both methods.
Let's use prime numbers.

`Flag :`
