Hi! I'm 0x70sec


I'm gonna tell you a little about myself, My experience of `OSCP`, Share some useful thoughts and links.


# [](#header-1)A Little About Me

I'm Cyber Security enthusiast from Georgia.I've dropped out of university in 2019 and started preparing for `OSCP`.
I knew a little bit of networking, programming and web.After a few months of preparation i took PWK course for 1 month and got my oscp in May.

### [](#header-3)Lab/Exam
I took 1 month of PWK course, Did all the exercises and compromised all of the lab machines.If you have 7-8+ hours free time a day
it should be enough for you too.
### Advices for Lab:
* Don't use metasploit for every exploit, some exploits need tweaking(Hardcoded IP,Compiling issues..) and you should be able to work with code,change it.
* Don't use forum hints if you aren't stuck for a day or two
* Don't use Kernel exploits if it's not intended way of PE
* Take Notes
* Communicate with other students/staff

I took Exam on a daylight at 13:00 and Finished it in 10 hours,compromised 5/5 machines.
### Advices for Exam:
* Use [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) 
* Manage Time
* Avoid Rabbit Holes
* Take Breaks
* Double Check Everything


### [](#header-4)Final Thoughts/Links
There's so many Great `OSCP` Reviews/Preparation guides,that i think a few thoughts and links should be enough.
My experience of OSCP was great,I learned a lot, I can't recommend this course enough, especially now that they added more resoursces/lab machines.In short Ippsec helped me a lot [TJNull's List](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLidcsTyj9JXK-fnabFLVEvHinQ14Jy5tf), i was doing HTB/Vulnhub machines and watching ippsec before i took course.Follow [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp) for more resources.
