**Hello World!** 
This is my first [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) post hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme I use is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), by [Michael Rose](https://twitter.com/mmistakes).

Thanks for stopping by!

**Testing Code Blocks:**
```python
x = "Coding while using VS Code with an absurd amount of "
y = "customizations and extensions is fun."
print (x + y)
```
